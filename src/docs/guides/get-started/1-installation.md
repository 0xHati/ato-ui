# Installation



## Dependencies


## Recommended VSCode Extensions

We recommend installing a few VSCode extensions to make the development experience more enjoyable. The [Unocss extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=antfu.unocss) and the [Iconify Intellisense extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=antfu.iconify).

If you have the Tailwind extension installed you probably also want to disable it for projects in which you are using UnoCSS, since the extensions might not work together well.
